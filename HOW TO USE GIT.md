Basically git, is a remote repository, where we can share our project and work via the internet without the need to copy our files the hard way/making clean copy and paste. Here it is slightly more sophisticated -> we can commit slight changes and even branch our whole project, so that we can reverse to a stable version.

To make this work:

0. OPTIONAL we can download a software for managing Source Control: eg Github Desktop or SourceTree. But for now I think we will be fine without it.

1. CLONE the repository - green button (download zip) and then PLACE this file somewhere in your documents on your desktop
2. bascially  you can now edit the file and when you are done upload it for us to see.
3. to make this work open (on Mac Terminal, in linux bash/command window)(on windows i dunno :(, do some wiki searching, i guess there are some dedicated modules for this). First use 'pwd' to check your directory, then use 'cd' to change directory so that the folder is open (you can pwd to make sure it is).
JUST COPY THE COMMANDS:

4. git add .
5. git commit -m "INSERT FILE NAME(MAIN.C??)"
6. git push origin master

now you can see that we have our own little server :333
I would like to ask you to upload one small .txt file so we can see it works
I hope this helps
